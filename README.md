# Class-Edit-Tracker
A way of tracking edits to the UVM Course Catalogue for the next semester

## Usage
Run with:

```
python populatefiles.py
open -a Microsoft\ Excell.app differences.csv
```

## Reading the CSV
Lines that were removed start with <

Lines that were added start with >

# Need to:
- Set the files to the same semester
- Recheck files each day
- Log the date that the file was changed
- Format the changes in a nice way
- Advertise the changes somehow

### I'd love to hear feedback if anyone wanted changes. Send me an email!
